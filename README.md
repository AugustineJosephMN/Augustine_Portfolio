## My Data Science Portfolio

# Project 1.https://github.com/AugustineJosephMN/Movie-recommendation-cloab-and-contentbased
Movie reccomentation system having both colaboratory and contentbased filtering.
Flask is used as front end. The movie-name is given and the most similar or co-related movie from Imdb dataset is choosen.
# Project 2.https://github.com/AugustineJosephMN/contactlens
Contact-lens.
Identify the eyeball and calculate the area of eyeball using open cv and place lens of different color.
The yolov3 is used to detect the eyeballs from face.
# Project 3.https://github.com/AugustineJosephMN/Feature-Engineering
# Feature-Engineering
## Different types of Missing Data.
1)Missing Completely at Random, MCAR:
2)Missing Data Not At Random(MNAR): Systematic missing Values
3)Missing At Random(MAR)
4)Mean/ MEdian /Mode imputation
5)Random Sample Imputation
6)Capturing NAN values with a new feature
7)Arbitrary Value Imputation
### How To Handle Categroical Missing Values
1.Frequent Category Imputation
2.Compute the frequency with every feature
3.Adding a variable to capture NAN
### Handle Categorical Features
1.One Hot Encoding
2.Count Or Frequency Encoding
3.Target Guided Ordinal Encoding
5.Mean Encoding
6.Probability Ratio Encoding
### Transformation of Features
### Types Of Transformation
1.Normalization And Standardization
2.Scaling to Minimum And Maximum values
3.Scaling To Median And Quantiles
4.Guassian Transformation Logarithmic Transformation,Reciprocal Trnasformation,Square Root Transformation,Exponential Trnasformation,Box Cox Transformation
### Standardization
### Min Max Scaling (### CNN)---Deep Learning Techniques
### Robust Scaler
#### IQR = 75th quantile - 25th quantile
#### X_scaled = (X - X.median) / IQR
### BoxCOx Transformation

# Feature-Selection-Techniques
## Dropping constant features
1.Variance Threshold 
2.Correlation
3.Mutual Information In Classification Problem Statements
